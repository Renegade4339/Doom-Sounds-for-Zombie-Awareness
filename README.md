# DSZA (Doom Sounds for Zombie Awareness)
### Pronounced as Dis-Zah

Changes sounds from those of the Zombiemen from Classic Doom. This also fixed [a known issue from the mod](https://github.com/Corosauce/ZombieAwareness/issues/139) that supplies mono audio from the resounds. It also changes the subtitles to be a bit more vague but kindof more vanilla-like.
